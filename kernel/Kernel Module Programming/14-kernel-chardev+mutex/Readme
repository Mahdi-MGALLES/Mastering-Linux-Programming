This brings us to the important difference between the mutex and semaphore. Mutex have ownership associated with it. The process that acquires the lock is the one that should unlock the mutex. While such ownership didnâ€™t exist with the semaphore. While using the semaphores for synchronization, its completely upto the user to ensure that the down & up are always called in pairs. But, mutex is designed in a way that lock and unlock must always be called in pairs.
