Starting gdb:
$ cc -g -o debug3 debug3.c
$ gdb debug3

Running a Program:
(gdb) run
Stack Trace:
(gdb) backtrace


(gdb) break 11
Now, I asked GDB to start the execution of the program:
(gdb) run

(gdb) print out

I asked the debugger to continue the execution of the program until the next breakpoint, something which can be done using the 'c' command.
