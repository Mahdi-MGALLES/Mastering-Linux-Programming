When you start a child process with fork , it takes on a life of its own and runs independently. Sometimes,
you would like to find out when a child process has finished. For example, in the previous program, the
parent finishes ahead of the child and you get some messy output as the child continues to run. You can
arrange for the parent process to wait until the child finishes before continuing by calling wait .
